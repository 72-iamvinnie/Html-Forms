An HTML form is an essential element used by websites to collect user data in the form of contact information, feedback, or even a purchase order. If you’ve ever filled out a contact form, registered for an event, or signed up for a newsletter, you’ve interacted with an HTML form. It contains different form fields such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down menus, and submit buttons that users can interact with to send data to a server.

HTML forms can be tailored for various purposes, such as customer support, sales inquiries, event RSVPs, and more.
